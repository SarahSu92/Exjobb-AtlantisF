    budget: `The Azores is generally more affordable than mainland Portugal’s big cities or other Atlantic islands. 
Budget travelers can spend around €60–€100 per day by staying in guesthouses, cooking some meals, and using 
public transport or shared tours. Mid-range travelers typically spend €120–€200 per day, staying in comfortable 
hotels, renting cars for island exploration, and joining activities like whale-watching tours or hot spring visits. 
Luxury travelers may spend €250–€400+ per day, staying in upscale boutique hotels, dining at fine restaurants, renting 
cars or booking private tours, and enjoying spa experiences or premium excursions. Inter-island flights or ferries 
may add costs depending on your itinerary, but overall the Azores offers excellent value for nature-focused travel.`,
